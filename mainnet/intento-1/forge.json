    "description": "Intento is a purpose-built blockchain for orchestrating intent-driven actions across IBC-connected chains. It enables secure, self-custodial execution of flows using real-time inputs, Interchain Accounts, and Interchain Queries â€” no smart contracts required. At its core is the intent engine, supported by trustless agents that execute cross-chain actions while keeping flows fully self-custodial. This design allows users and developers to build anything from simple scheduled payments to complex interchain workflows, turning intent into action across the interchain.",
