## Overview

This repository provides essential resources for node operators and validators participating in the `Intento` network. It includes configuration files, scripts, and guidelines to help streamline the setup process. 

## Installation

Each network directory contains an example installation script (`create_node.sh`) to automate the setup. To install a node for a specific network, navigate to the respective network directory and run:

```bash
cd <network-directory>
chmod +x create_node.sh
./create_node.sh
```

This script will install dependencies, download the required binaries, and configure the node accordingly. For validators, it is also necesarry to opt-in to the consumer chain. More information is available in the respective network's README.

## Chain Configurations

Each network directory contains:

- `genesis.json` – Initial chain state
- `addrbook.json` – Peer addresses for network connectivity

Make sure to update these files according to the latest network requirements.
